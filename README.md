# CookieProject

What is a cookie project?

We basically distribute cookies to the students and teachers to show them our gratitude with notes included. 

The problem : We received a lot of request for the cookie, hence the note which overloads us with a lot of copy pasting messages from excel to a small piece of note and I find it to be inefficient. 

The solution : So, I wrote my own code to transfer all the messages from the Excel File to a formatted sized note on an A4 paper.
